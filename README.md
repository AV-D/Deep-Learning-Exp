# Deep Learning Model Comparisons

## Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of different neural network architectures and configurations on a specific classification task. The experiments are conducted using TensorFlow and PyTorch, two of the leading frameworks for deep learning. The notebook includes detailed steps for model training, performance evaluation, and comparative analysis.

## Theoretical Background
To fully understand this project, one should be familiar with the following concepts:

1. **Neural Networks**: Models that are designed to recognize patterns and make decisions based on complex data inputs. They are inspired by the human brain and are used widely in areas such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

2. **TensorFlow**: An open-source library developed by Google to create deep learning models. It allows for the building and training of neural networks with robust capabilities for large-scale machine learning.

3. **PyTorch**: Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, this library provides flexibility and speed in deep learning applications. It is particularly favored for applications that require complex, variable-length computational graphs, and it excels in gradient descent optimization techniques.

4. **Classification Accuracy**: A performance metric that determines the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

5. **Activation Functions**: Functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh that help determine the output of neural network nodes. Different functions can significantly affect the learning and performance of a model.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/AV-D/Deep-learning-Experiments.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:
```
cd Deep-learning-Experiments
```

## Usage
To run the notebook, ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. Open the terminal and run:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the `Pytorch_and_Tensorflow_implementation.ipynb` file and open it.

## Models Evaluated
- **Model 1**: Simple neural network with basic layers.
- **Model 2**: A more complex architecture with additional layers and nodes.
- **Model 3**: Modifications in activation functions.
- **Model 4**: Best performing model with Tanh activation in hidden layers and linear activation in output layer.

## Results
The results section in the notebook provides a detailed comparison of each model's accuracy and performance metrics.
